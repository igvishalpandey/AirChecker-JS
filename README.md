# Air Quality Information Web App

## Overview

The Air Quality Information Web App is a simple web application that fetches real-time air quality data for a specified location using the WeatherAPI. It displays the air quality index (AQI) along with relevant health implications and air pollution levels to help users understand the current air quality situation in their area.

## Features

- **Real-Time Air Quality Data**: The app fetches current air quality data from the WeatherAPI based on the user's location input.
- **Color-Coded Display**: The AQI is color-coded to visually represent air quality levels, making it easier for users to understand.
- **Health Implications**: Provides information on health implications associated with the current air quality level.
- **Cautionary Statements**: Offers cautionary statements and advice based on the air pollution level to help users take necessary precautions.

## Learnings

- Working with external APIs to fetch real-time data.
- Manipulating DOM elements and updating content dynamically based on data.
- Implementing color-coded visualizations for better user understanding.
- Incorporating additional functionality like modal alerts for user interaction.

## Technologies Used

- **JavaScript**: Core programming language used for logic and interaction.
- **HTML/CSS**: Markup and styling languages for structuring the web page and designing the user interface.
- **WeatherAPI**: External API used to fetch real-time air quality data based on user input.

## Getting Started
